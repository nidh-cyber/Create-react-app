Creating a React App without npm from scratch:
This repo demonstrates how to set up a React Application from scratch without relying only on npm for package management.

This project uses the following dependencies:
React: The core library for building user interfaces.
Babel: A Javascript transpiler/compiler which converts js element into jsx.
Webpack: A module bundler for managing assets and building the project.
Parcel: It is a fast and zero-config web application bundler. It simplifies the process of building web applications by automating tasks such as Js and css bundling,etc.
